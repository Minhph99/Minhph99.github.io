My name is Pham Huu Minh. I was born in 1999, at Hai Phong city, Viet Nam. I have a bachelor about mechatronics in Hanoi University of Science and Technology. I was a Linux embedded developer at FPT Software, Viettel Aerospace Institute and Panasonic R&D Center Vietnam. 
I am keen on Linux Embedded and hope you guys will find something useful in my blog.
